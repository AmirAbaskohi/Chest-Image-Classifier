# Covid-19-Classifier
This is a predictor to determine patient has Covid-19, Pneumonia, or non form xray images.
We are going to train a model to classify `x-ray` images of chest to recognize that person has `Covid` or not.

This is done using `Keras` in `Tenorflow`.

Also we will examine some parameters and function on this model.
